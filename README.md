This project tries to find the impact of music on mental health using R and different statistical techniques. There were some limitations because of the data set.

It contains: 
1.	Stratified random sampling(confidence intervals for population mean and total taking into account different scenarios for the margin of error or significance level)
2.	Hypothesis testing (two scenarios: one-tailed and two-tailed test)
3.	Anova analysis
4.	Simple linear regression analysis
5.	Multiple linear regression analysis(bifactorial model, dummy variable, interaction terms)
